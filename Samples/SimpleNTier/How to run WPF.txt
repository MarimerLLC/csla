1. Build the solution
First of all, build the solution (CTRL+SHIT+B) or else the server folder will be missing 
the Data Access Layer (DAL) assembly.

2. Set WpfUI as Startup Project.

3. Start the Application Server
Debug with F5 to start the application server (WcfHost).
After it's started, you can break the debug and run normally with CTRL F5.

Note - This project uses a local application server at http://localhost:21647
and WcfPortal.svc service for WcfProxy proxy.
(have a look at WpfUI App.config)
