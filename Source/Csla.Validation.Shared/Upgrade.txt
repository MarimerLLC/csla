Add ValidationRules (and BusinessRules extensions) to CSLA  to support “old” style validation rules.

1.  Change code to override CanReadProperty(IPropertyInfo)/CanWriteProperty(IPropertyInfo)/CanExecuteMethod(IMethodInfo) in your code.

2.  Recommended: Create intermediate base classes (if you do not have them already).

3.  CommandObjects now make a copy (serialize) before calling Execute (ie: all fields must be serializable).

4.  CriteriaBase is now a generic base class and must have generic constraint.

5.  SingleCriteria should be removed – is considered obsolete but still included in 4.x.

6.	Recommended: All BO/CommandObjects/CriteriaBase objects should have managed properties only.

7.	Update Csla.Validation.BrokenRulesCollection.Merge method to accept Csla.Rules.BrokenRulesCollection as parameter.

8.	ObjectFactory – CommandObjects will call the “Execute” method - not "Update".

Deprecated:  Add Csla.Validation.BrokenRulesCollection to support BindingList based broken rules.
