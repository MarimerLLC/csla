Add ValidationRules (and BusinessRules extensions) to CSLA  to support “old” style validation rules.

<<<<<<< HEAD
1.  Change code to override CanReadProperty(IPropertyInfo)/CanWriteProperty(IPropertyInfo)/CanExecuteMethod(IMethodInfo) in your code.

2.  Recommended: Create intermediate base classes (if you do not have them already).

3.  CommandObjects now make a copy (serialize) before calling Execute (ie: all fields must be serializable).

4.  CriteriaBase is now a generic base class and must have generic constraint.

5.  SingleCriteria may be removed – is considered obsolete but still included in 4.x.

6.	Recommended: All BO/CommandObjects/CriteriaBase objects should have managed properties only.

7.	Update Csla.Validation.BrokenRulesCollection.Merge method to accept Csla.Rules.BrokenRulesCollection as parameter.

8.	ObjectFactory – CommandObjects will call the “Execute” method - not "Update".
=======
1.  AddAuthorizationRules method no longer exists. Move this code to AddBusinessRules method.  
 
2.  Change code to override CanReadProperty(IPropertyInfo)/CanWriteProperty(IPropertyInfo)/
      CanExecuteMethod(IMethodInfo) in your code (as it is these that gets called by SetProperty/
      GetProperty and the rule engine).
 
3.  Recommended: Create intermediate base classes (if you do not have them already).
 
4.  CommandObjects now make a copy (serialize) before calling Execute (ie: all fields must be serializable).
 
5.  CriteriaBase is generic base class in CSLA 4.5 and must have generic constraint.
 
6.  Recommended: All BO/CommandObjects/CriteriaBase objects should have managed properties whenever possible.
 
7.  ObjectFactory – CommandObjects will call the “Execute” method - not "Update".

8. The "old" style 3.x rule engine supported both Allow/Deny authorization rules (both active). 
    The Csla 4.x rule engine only supports one rule (so etiher IsInRole or IsNotInRole rule). 

9. In AddObjectAuthorizationRules method you must update code to call static methods on the class 
Csla.Security.AuthorizationRules
