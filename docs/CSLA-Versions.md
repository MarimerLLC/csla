## Upgrading

1.	The upgrade difficulty depends on your current version
   1.	From 1.x â€“ it is a rewrite (but to be fair, that code was obsoleted 14 years ago ðŸ˜Š )
   1.	From 2.x-3.6 â€“ it requires quite a lot of changes (removing now-obsolete code), but the process is typically mechanical/repetitive, not hard
      1.	EXCEPT if your UI is WinForms, in which case we enhanced CSLA to reveal some nasty UI bugs with data binding, so those bugs are often revealed as people move to or past v3.0.5
   1.	From 3.8 â€“ requires wrapping of old-style business rules into the new rules engine model
   1.	From 4.0 â€“ thereâ€™ve been some minor breaking changes that donâ€™t affect everyone, but reviewing the release notes to see if a given codebase is affected is required

Fwiw, CSLA 4 came out 7 years ago, and thereâ€™ve been no _major_ breaking changes since then. Really thereâ€™ve been 3 major breaking change points in CSLA .NETâ€™s 18 year history:

1.	Add support for .NET generics and a rules engine in v2
1.	Major changes to support Silverlight, Windows Phone, .NET Core, mono, Xamarin, etc. in v3.8
1.	New rules engine in v4

Even the upcoming v5 release has no truly major breaking changes. I did switch to semantic versioning starting with v4.9.0, which helps keep track of when to expect trouble. So current is 4.11.2, meaning 6 releases without breaking changes â€“ only bug fixes and enhancements since Oct 2018. Weâ€™ve saved up all the breaking changes for the v5 release.

â€¢	The rename of all NuGet packages will break everyone: https://github.com/MarimerLLC/csla/issues/1151
a.	Fix is just to update all NuGet references, so very mechanical
â€¢	Moving use of SqlClient to its own NuGet package will break a lot of people (but was forced due to .NET Core): https://github.com/MarimerLLC/csla/issues/981 
a.	Fix is to add another NuGet package reference (either for the old System.Data or the new Microsoft.Data implementation)

All the other items in the list will affect only narrow subsets of the overall CSLA user base.

## Future Roadmap

The roadmap is [available here](https://github.com/MarimerLLC/csla/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aroadmap).

## Version Background
CSLA .NET 3.0.5 is the recommended version for .NET 2.0 and 3.0. It introduced support for .NET 3.0 features: WPF, WCF, WF. It includes a wide array of bug fixes and features around Windows Forms, and other .NET 2.0 scenarios.

Anyone using CSLA .NET 2.x should upgrade to 3.0.5.

CSLA .NET 3.6-3.8 added support for Silverlight, ADO.NET Entity Framework and other .NET 3.5 and 3.5 SP1 features. This also includes support for ASP.NET MVC.

Starting in 3.6, code reduction was a major focus. So writing classes against 3.8 (current) means writing probably less than 50% of the code from early versions.

If you are using .NET 3.5 or Silverlight 3, you should use CSLA .NET 3.8.

If you are using .NET 4 or Silverlight 4, you should use CSLA 4, because CSLA 4 was created for this platform.

CSLA 4 also includes code reduction, and more abstraction around the data portal, and support for ASP.NET MVC 3.

CSLA 4 version 4.2 adds support for mono on Mac, Linux, iOS, and Android. It includes bug fixes for .NET, Silverlight, and WP7.

CSLA 4 version 4.5 adds support for .NET 4.5 and WinRT (Windows 8), including the use of the new async and await keywords. It drops support for WP7 and Silverlight 4. Silverlight 5 and .NET 4 are supported through the use of Microsoft's async targeting pack library for Visual Studio 2012 (via nuget).

CSLA 4 version 4.6.603 drops support for Silverlight and Windows Phone.

CSLA 4 version 4.7 introduces early support for WebAssembly and Blazor, ASP.NET Core, and Xamarin updates.

CSLA 4 version 4.9.0 is the beginning of our use of semantic versioning. It supports .NET Core configuration via a fluent API, plus major data portal enhancements for container-based server environments such as Kubernetes.

CSLA version 5.0.0 has a number of [breaking changes](https://github.com/MarimerLLC/csla/issues?q=is%3Aissue+project%3AMarimerLLC%2Fcsla%2F5+label%3A%22flag%2Fbreaking+change%22). The primary focus in this version is _major_ enhancements to the data portal, including support for dependency injection, flexible method names, and multiple criteria parameters. And of course, support for .NET Core 3.
