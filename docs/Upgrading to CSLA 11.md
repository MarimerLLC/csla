# Upgrading to CSLA 11

CSLA 11 is a major release and so there are a number of breaking changes.

In this document I'll try to highlight the most common changes required when upgrading your codebase from CSLA 10 to CSLA 11.

If you are upgrading from a version of CSLA prior to 10, you should review the [Upgrading to CSLA 10](https://github.com/MarimerLLC/csla/blob/main/docs/Upgrading%20to%20CSLA%2010.md) document, as most of its contents are relevant. This document only covers the changes from CSLA 10 to CSLA 11.

## Platform Support

CSLA 11 supports .NET 10 and .NET 11, and continues to support .NET Framework 4.6.2 and later. CSLA 11 no longer targets .NET 8 or .NET 9.

## Legacy Data Portal Operation Method Names Removed

In earlier versions, if the data portal couldn't find a method with an operation attribute (such as `[Fetch]`), it fell back to looking for a method by name (such as `DataPortal_Fetch` or `Child_Update`). This fallback was controlled by the `DataPortalOptions.UseLegacyOperationMethods` option.

In CSLA 11 this fallback is removed. The data portal only invokes methods that have an operation attribute. The `UseLegacyOperationMethods` option is also removed.

If your business classes have operation methods with no attribute, add the matching attribute:

| Legacy method name | Attribute |
|---|---|
| `DataPortal_Create` | `[Create]` |
| `DataPortal_Fetch` | `[Fetch]` |
| `DataPortal_Insert` | `[Insert]` |
| `DataPortal_Update` | `[Update]` |
| `DataPortal_Delete` | `[Delete]` |
| `DataPortal_DeleteSelf` | `[DeleteSelf]` |
| `DataPortal_Execute` | `[Execute]` |
| `Child_Create` | `[CreateChild]` |
| `Child_Fetch` | `[FetchChild]` |
| `Child_Insert` | `[InsertChild]` |
| `Child_Update` | `[UpdateChild]` |
| `Child_DeleteSelf` | `[DeleteSelfChild]` |
| `Child_Execute` | `[ExecuteChild]` |

The same applies to the `Async` variants of these names (for example `DataPortal_FetchAsync`).

Before:

```csharp
[Serializable]
public class Customer : BusinessBase<Customer>
{
  private void DataPortal_Fetch(int id)
  {
    // ...
  }
}
```

After:

```csharp
[Serializable]
public class Customer : BusinessBase<Customer>
{
  [Fetch]
  private void DataPortal_Fetch(int id)
  {
    // ...
  }
}
```

Once a method has an attribute, you can rename it to anything you like (for example `Fetch`).

A method with a legacy name and no attribute is never called. Instead, the data portal throws an exception at runtime because it can't find a matching operation method.

### Finding affected methods

The `CSLA0014` analyzer finds methods that use a legacy operation name but have no operation attribute. In CSLA 11 it reports a warning instead of an informational message. The analyzer's code fix adds the correct attribute for you. See [CSLA0014](analyzers/CSLA0014-DoesOperationHaveAttributeAnalyzer.md).

<!-- TODO(#4828 Stage B): document the base class behavior changes once decided:
  - D1: "not supported" DataPortal_XYZ stubs in CommandBase, ReadOnlyBase, ReadOnlyListBase, etc.
  - D2: default Child_Create in BusinessBase (calls BusinessRules.CheckRules), BusinessListBase, BusinessBindingListBase
  - D3: Child_Create lookup for ObjectFactory types
  - D4: sync Child_Update(params object[]) in BusinessListBase, BusinessBindingListBase, BusinessDocumentBase
-->
