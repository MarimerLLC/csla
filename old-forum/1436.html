<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>What are the commitments and pains I can expect when using CAB with CSLA?</DIV>
<DIV>What about Smart Client Software Factory? I haven't look at this but do you mean SC-SF creates these 100 solutions, one for separate module in CAB?</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Please advise me whether I should go with CAB as a standard UI framework for my CSLA application development? Or, do you encounter any other UI framework out there that facilitates MVC or MVP architecture?</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>

You should think carefully as to what benefits they can provide for you and your app. They are very powerful but still evolving quite quickly. I have been looking at both and have done an evaluation project with CAB and have noticed that concepts can change as more people use it and especially as the reference applications have been developed. This is to be expected so you should not go in thinking this is all finished. </P>
<P>In my opinion CAB is useful if you need a degree of plugability and integration for diverse application modules because there is a lot more work involved than writing a straight forward winforms UI. </P>
<P>I concur with Andy, using CSLA based business logic should present no problems - getting your head around some of the CAB concepts is another matteer altogether. There is some really neat stuff in there: the Object Builder dependency injection support stuff for one. </P>
<P>You should check out the following <A href="https://blogs.msdn.com/eugeniop/">https://blogs.msdn.com/eugeniop/</A>&nbsp;links to a series of interviews with Peter Provost a lead in the MS P&amp;P team who is very informative on CAB and SCSF internals and development thoughts</P>

I think I will not attempt to adopt CAB in my project for time being until I discovered the full benefits of it&nbsp;at later time.&nbsp;My reasoning is that&nbsp;CAB dictates the application UI architecture; just like CSLA to business components. However, CAB is&nbsp;kind like an&nbsp;in-progress stuff, which MS might "drop" it. CSLA is more matured&nbsp;in this sense. I think Rocky is not going to "drop" it... :)</DIV>

<P>Hi,</P>
<P>I stumbled across this post in search of cues on how to use both CSLA and SCSF.</P>
<P>I understand that the Presenter is a good place to instantiate the BO.</P>
<P>What I don't quite understand yet, probably for lack of a working sample, is how you achieve DataBinding between the BO and the View. Or do you discard that completely ?</P>
<P>Or maybe you implement some DataBinding interface on the Presenter to bind the BO to it instead of the View ?</P>
<P>Or do you simply pass the BO to the View ?</P>
<P>Whatever the answer is, I'm curious to know.</P>
<P>Thanks.</P>

with very good result, although I’m prototyping my system.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">What I do is instantiate my BO in the UseCase’s
WorkitemController and add it to the WorkItem.Items collection. Then using CAB’s
dependency injection [Service Dependency] I create then it in the presenter(s) where I’m going to
use it. In each presenter’s view I bind to the BO via a presenter public property.
I also instanciate my NameValueLists and ReadOnlyLists in the
WorkItemController(and add them to the Items collection) so I can share them in
my presenters to fill my combo and list boxes.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><br></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Right now I’m mixing WPF and WindowsForms controls in my
views and binding them to the same BO. Actually, all my views are in WPF(SCSFContrib),
but when I need a grid control (which WPF lacks) I create a WindowsFormsHost in
the view, <span>&nbsp;</span>which encapsulates a
Windows.Forms.UserControl which has the grid (DevExpress). That way I can
change my view when the WPF Grid control arrives. BTW a tried Xceed and
Infragistics WPF grid but had a lot of troubles binding to a my BusinessLists.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><br></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In the views I bind to the BO throuth standard WPF
DataContext (thou you have to make you presenter implement
INotifyPropertyChanged if you want to bind to a presenter property and get
updates) and use the standard BindingSource in the Windows.Forms UserControl’s
grid.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><br></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I’m not working in the computer where I have the code but I
could post it if you’re interested.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><br></p>

<P>The pain with CAB is that it's a lot of work and rework to get organized.&nbsp; I actually tried CAB before SCSF was released but gave up because the learning curve was high and the time it took to create a single module was great.&nbsp; SCSF relieves some of the pain in that it creates the modules and dependent projects for you.&nbsp; What SCSF also does is show you how much work it really is to use CAB for your UI.<o:p></o:p></P>
<P>My point about the commitment is this:&nbsp; I have little or no doubt that if you spent some time leaning the ins and outs of CAB, and you had an application or enterprise of applications that could really make use it, and that the benefit you might gain would offset the costs of all the time it would take to use it, that it would be really great.<o:p></o:p></P>
<P>I can't tell you whether you should go with CAB for your UI framework (whether you use CSLA isn't really an issue here.)&nbsp; I will say this.&nbsp; My company is a perfect candidate for CAB.&nbsp; We have around 20 small internal&nbsp;applications and 3 major external applications that almost all work together in some fashion.&nbsp; We are currently rewriting all of these applications in .NET 2.0 with CSLA.&nbsp; However, getting 6 developers up to speed using CAB together to create the 'plug-in' architecture would cost us too much time and money.&nbsp; It's very possible that we may regret it at some point in the future but the nail in the coffin is that MS could drop it at any time&nbsp;when one of their teams comes up with the 'next best thing'.<o:p></o:p></P>
<P>As for other frameworks; I really cannot say because I don't have experience with any of them.</P>
<P>No offence to any of the CAB folks out there, this was just my experience.<o:p></o:p></P>

In my opinion they form a winning team together.<br><br>Many people seem to think you would need to 'merge' the two frameworks, but that is exactly what you should <b>not</b> do.<br>- CSLA is a business objects framework, it provides validation, authorization (and if you wish also authentication), business logic, etc. In addition it allows her BOs to be visualized and maintained easily by supporting databinding and errorproviders.<br>- CAB us <b>exclusively</b> about UI logic, targeted at flexibility and it also strongly promotes view reuse.<br><br>Just like you model CSLA's BOs after use cases, so would you with CABs WorkItems. A single WorkItem can manage multiple views in order to fullfill the designated use case. In addition, your workitems can remain agnostic to rendering specific details as these go into your controllers/presenters (what's in a name ...). Then, on top of that: you can put higher level view-logic in your controllers and the actual low-level rendering logic in your views. This allows one view to be reused by different controllers and also one controller to be attached to different views. Highly dynamic UIs, low maintenance costs and heavy reuse <i>could</i> thus be achieved. <br><br>There is a strong learning curve associated to getting up-to-speed with CAB indeed. Personally, I feel I got return on investment already after my first app. By having a powerful tool as CAB in your toolkit that can handle really complex UIs, I have never been tempted to take the wrong path of implementing UI-specific details in my BOs. On this forum already, many people want to get their BOs to communicate to each other, e.g. using Petar's observer pattern as implemented in ActiveObjects. But more often than not, the desired communication is just for UI requirements since one view needs to be synchronized with another. With CAB you would have the EventBroker and State frameworks that preclude moving UI logic in your BOs.<br><br>As you probably noticed I am strongly in facour of using CAB, despite the learning curve. I did not find it too hard actually, as most of it made sense to me.<br><br>If you need further details, I would gladly be of assistance.<br><br>Kind regards,<br>Bayu<br></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
