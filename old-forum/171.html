Yes, what I write in my previous post is basically the approach outlined by guyroch (this._id = MyOrm.CustomerId;). That snippet was what I called as procedure to extract info into BO. What needs to be highlighted is the fact that MyORM (and other persistence object, e.g.: DataReader) has to be in local scope, and not in instance scope. This means that the ORM object should be discarded each time it's used, and should be somehow reconstructed on another call.<br>However, that is usually not quite an easy task. You may notice that only a small part of the MyORM content extracted into BO. How do I managed the rest?

<P>I am envisioning a design whereby a business object knows only how to accept or pass an XML representation of its data.&nbsp; The DAL (which could possible be an ORM or NHibernate??) knows how to get that XML DTO from the database.&nbsp; The beauty I'm seeing here is that it is a fairly simple matter at that point to wrap something like a web service around the business objects.&nbsp; No significant additional translation functionality or classes necessary, just another way the XMLDTOs get in and out of the BO.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, May 24, 2006</h2><P>Dan,</P>
<P>I've been toying with something along this line. In the VB6 CSLA I used a structure to contain an object's data, and I'm thinking that perhaps a return to such a model (with the exception of child object references) is part of the overall solution. If you object keeps all its data (except child references) in a DTO (class or structure) then you have the means (with the XmlSerialize or DataContractSerializer) to easily convert that state into/out of XML.</P>
<P>Either that, or use DataMapper to easily copy the values into/out of the DTO - but that seems like an extra copy that may not be necessary if you are willing to always access your "fields" through a _state variable.</P>
<P>Instead of x = 10 you'd write _state.x = 10.</P>
<P>There is an impact here in terms of n-level undo, because this DTO would be treated as a single field in the object. However, as long as it is marked as serializable there's no issue - and marking it as serializable doesn't interfere with the XmlSerializer.</P>
<P>To me the primary drawback is that you have to declare/code the DTO, and it probably needs to be in its own assembly so it can be shared between your business assembly and your data assembly. On the other hand, you can use public fields (because you'll never data bind directly to the DTO) so that reduces the coding effort quite a lot <img src="/emoticons/emotion-1.gif" alt="Smile [:)]" /></P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>DavidDilworth replied on Thursday, May 25, 2006</h2><P>I think I see where you want to go with this idea and I've seen&nbsp;Rocky's response as well.</P>
<P>But I'm not convined that an ORM tool is what is needed to do this job though.&nbsp; It sounds to me like you're talking about the DTO being an XML formatted object, or containing an XML object.&nbsp; So the initial transformation that's needed is from relational data tables into structured XML.&nbsp; That's not ORM (Object Relational Mapping), but perhaps something called XRM (XML Relational Mapping).&nbsp; Yes that&nbsp;XML is part of an object&nbsp;(the DTO), but it's not a BO in the sense that we talk about them with relation to CSLA.</P>
<P>What NHibernate gives you is a way of mapping the relational data tables directly into the private member fields of your BO.&nbsp; Or you can go through the public properties if you want instead.&nbsp; </P>
<P>So we're using it to replace the kind of code you'd traditionally write in your DataPortal_Fetch(), such as:</P>
<P>_id = dr.GetGuid("Id");<BR>_name = dr.GetString("Name");<BR>_started = dr.GetSmartDate("Started", _started.EmptyIsMin);<BR>_ended = dr.GetSmartDate("Ended", _ended.EmptyIsMin);<BR>_description = dr.GetString("Description");</P>
<P>which instead becomes a single call in the base class:</P><FONT size=2>
<P>session.Load(</FONT><FONT color=#0000ff size=2>this</FONT><FONT size=2>, identifier);</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>(see the fuller example in my earlier post).</P></FONT>
<P>For the DTO concept to work then the definition of the object should be driven by the XSD schema definition in the web service via the WSDL, which defines your contract with the outside world.</P>
<P>We're currently running a Web Service project using a technique called Web Services Contract First (WSCF).&nbsp; This starts with the contract (i.e. interface) you agree with the outside world for your Web Service.&nbsp; We've found that going down this route you then need facade classes to bridge between the class definitions used by the Web Service and those of your BO.&nbsp; These are somewhat analagous to the "facade" classes in the ProjectTracker Web Services example, where the code maps the data between the BO class and Web Service class.&nbsp; In our case, the two are not exactly 100% the same - things are never that easy <img src="/emoticons/emotion-5.gif" alt="Wink [;)]" /></P>

<P>While the undo could still work as is, wouldn't it be better to take advantage of the fact that we would then know that what we want to save as "state" is precisely and only this state object?&nbsp; No need to wade through all the properties of the BO and do all that checking and filtering.</P>
<P>David, I think the ORM&nbsp;still applies in that case as you still need data access code to get the data into that state class.</P>
<P>I think what I was describing is a slightly different thing, or maybe it's a part of the bigger picture including this concept.&nbsp; Considering Chapter 11, what if we move some of the facade concept into the BO class itself?&nbsp; For example, what if we had something like:</P>
<P>private DataPortal_Fetch(SimpleCriteria criteria)<BR>{<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ProjectData[] data =&nbsp;SomeDAL.GetProjectList(criteria);<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; loadFromDataArray(data);<BR>}</P>
<P>private&nbsp;void loadFromDataArray(ProjectData[] dataArray)<BR>{<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; // Load from the ProjectData array as&nbsp;demonstrated in Chapter 11<BR>}</P>
<P>Then it's easy peasy to add a factory method</P>
<P>public static ProjectList LoadProjectList(ProjectData[] dataArray)<BR>{<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; loadFromDataArray(dataArray);<BR>}</P>
<P>And that in turn makes the web method to add Projects really just a simple pass through if it accepts an XML structure representing a list of ProjectData data.&nbsp; Ok, I'm sort of typing this thinking out load, but I think you'll see what I'm driving at.</P>
<P>Does this really provide a development productivity gain, or a loss because of increased complexity?&nbsp; Would it usually be the case that enough BOs need to be exposed through web services that it makes sense to do this as a general rule, or does it make more sense to just deal with what needs to be exposed via WS on a case by case basis?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, May 25, 2006</h2>

<DIV align=left><SPAN class=509534621-26052006><FONT face=Arial color=#0000ff size=2>The explicit approach is acceptable, other than that you 
should be able to mark it as protected, because that is a common 
requirement.</FONT></SPAN></DIV>
<DIV align=left><SPAN class=509534621-26052006><FONT face=Arial color=#0000ff size=2></FONT></SPAN>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV align=left><SPAN class=509534621-26052006><FONT face=Arial color=#0000ff size=2>It is limited, in that multiple interfaces require multiple 
method implementations - often routing to the same common implementation method 
- where VB's approach allows you to explicitly map interface methods to any 
class method that has the same signature. So if you have two interfaces with a 
Foo() method in VB you can have a single implementation method for 
both.</FONT></SPAN></DIV>

<DIV align=left><SPAN class=509534621-26052006><FONT face=Arial color=#0000ff size=2>My complaint is with the implicit implementation. You can't 
look at the code for a method and know that the method implements something on 
an interface. You have to look at the class, see what interfaces it implements 
and then compare the method signature to all methods on those interfaces. That's 
the part that I find particularly sloppy. For an otherwise highly explicit and 
self-explanatory language, this kind of magic seems very inconsistent to 
me.</FONT></SPAN></DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I had to take over a c# project a couple of years ago and&nbsp;most classes implemented 3 or 4 interfaces.&nbsp; Curly braces and semicolons and all the other c#isms no problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even grew to like it. But&nbsp;that&nbsp;implicit interface implementation (didn't know it was called that) drove me nuts!&nbsp; Maybe it wouldn't be so bad if I was in on the ground up but coming in at the end (and the guy leaving)&nbsp;made that stuff a nightmare.&nbsp; It took forever to figure out what was doing what. And the classes that implemented interfaces that had the same member names or if you wanted to inherit from a class that happened to have a member with the same signature.....&nbsp; AHHHHHHH!&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I agree, the&nbsp;VB.Net way makes things much clearer.&nbsp; Call me a nooby mort all you want, I like the extra verbosity.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>(one other thing that killed me.&nbsp; There where some methods that where exactly the same except for the names where different case one protected the other public.&nbsp; Try inheriting from that in VB.&nbsp; I know, bad developer and not the language.

<span>I didn’t have a lot of time to write up the puesdo-code
at the time.<span>&nbsp; </span>The code could have been clearer.<span>&nbsp; </span>BusinessBase actually implements ILoadFromDAL
and contains the IloadFromDal.LoadingFromDAL property.<span>&nbsp; </span>The mLoadingFromDAL variable also resides in
the BusinessBase.<span>&nbsp; </span>Customer should have
inherited from BusiessBase as well.<span>&nbsp; </span>There
is actually a lot more code to this that I didn’t add for the sake of
brevity.<span>&nbsp; I will try to edit some of the code in that post to make it easier to understand.&nbsp; </span>Thanks for taking a look at

<P>So we anticipated that and decided to use a singleton pattern.&nbsp; Well actually a singleton&nbsp;HashTable of NHibernate.SessionFactory, as we are catering for multiple database usage.</P>
<P>So our line of code: </P>
<P>// Get an NHibernate session factory<BR>&nbsp;NH.ISessionFactory sessionFactory = Nfs.Nhibernate.Cfg.BuildSessionFactory(SessionFactoryKey);</P>
<P>doesn't create a new NHibernate.SessionFactory every time - only the first time a new SessionFactoryKey is requested.&nbsp; After that, it's simply returning the pre-built SessionFactory from the singleton HashTable (this is all handled inside our wrapper code - notice the namespace).</P>
<P>We could have chosen to wrap that code further as well to make it ORM neutral, which is what you've chosen to do.&nbsp; But we decided against that.</P>
<P>However, it's good to know that we're thinking along the same lines <img src="/emoticons/emotion-1.gif" alt="Smile [:)]" /></P>
