<P>(this is the source of at least one thread in the old forum, and at least two email discussions I've been having with readers)</P>
<P>The primary symptom is that some object ends up with its edit level at 1 even though, by all understanding, all objects should have edit level of 0. </P>
<P>The most common scenario is where a parent object, with a collection of child objects, is bound to controls on a single form (detail controls for the parent, grid for the child collection). In this scenario, one of the child objects ends up at edit level 1, even though the parent and all other child objects edit levels are at 0 because of an ApplyEdit call.</P>
<P>After researching this, I think I have the answer. This is not due to a bug in CSLA, or even misbehavior by either data binding or CSLA. Rather it is a lack of complete understanding (at least on my part) as to how to properly use the BindingSource controls (or at least that's how I'm viewing this at the moment <img src="/emoticons/emotion-5.gif" alt="Wink [;)]" />)</P>
<P>When you set up data binding in your form's constructor or load event handler, you may or may not manually call BeginEdit on the parent object (let's call it Employee). Then you set the BindingSource control's DataSource property:</P>
<P>Dim emp As Employee&nbsp;= Employee.GetEmployee(42)<BR>emp.BeginEdit() ' optional<BR>Me.EmployeeBindingSource.DataSource = emp</P>
<P>This not only starts data binding on the parent, but on its list of child objects (let's say phone numbers). Data binding, at this point, uses IEditableObject to call BeginEdit on the parent object - which is why the explicit BeginEdit call is optional - that call will happen one way or the other, but CSLA automatically makes sure only one call is actually honored.</P>
<P>Later, behind your Save button things get complex. In the book what I did (which is wrong) is to call ApplyEdit and Save. This, as it turns out, doesn't work right. Instead, you need to call EndEdit() on the BindingSource controls (not just the parent one, but the child one too!!) like this:</P>
<P>Me.EmployeeBindingSource.EndEdit()<BR>Me.PhoneListBindingSource.EndEdit()</P>
<P>The first line automatically calls ApplyEdit (actually IEditableObject.EndEdit) on the parent object, which cases a cascade call down to all child objects. This puts all objects at edit level 0 EXCEPT for the one row in the grid that is currently being edited by the user.</P>
<P>The second line causes an ApplyEdit (actually IEditableObject.EndEdit) call to the <EM>currently selected</EM> child object in the child collection. The result is that its edit level is now also set to 0.</P>
<P>With that done, you can proceed to save your object - using or not using the Clone() technique as discussed in the book, etc.</P>
<P>I think this resolves the issues people have been having. Certainly it appears to resolve them in my testing around this problem. Once I have independant confirmation (which can come from any/all of you who care to test the solution) I'll put entries on <A href="http://www.lhotka.net">www.lhotka.net</A> as errata.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>BARRY4679 replied on Monday, May 08, 2006</h2><p>I am seeing what I assume to be another aspect of this problem, which doesn&#39;t involve the save button. <br />To use your example I have an employee with it&#39;s grid of phone numbers. I click on a grid row to open up a modal dialogue box for one of the phone numbers. I do a beginedit in the dialogue box because it would be confusing if a undo action inside the dialogue box was able to undo an uncommitted change which was made back in the mainform. The closing event of my dialogue box has a canceledit.<br /><br />Use of the dialogue box elevates the editlevel of the examined phone number with relation to unexamined phone numbers (presumably due to the implicit beginedit mentined in your post, and Ross&#39; (Tetranz4) post in the old newsgroup.<br /><br />This means that a canceledit back in the mainform can cause corruption, as any rows examined by the dialogue box are not undone.<br /><br />The issue can be resolved by calling canceledit twice on the phone number in the closing event of the dialogue box. Once for my BeginEdit and once for the implicit BeginEdit caused by the attachment of the datasource.<br /><br />However, unless I have a bug of my own this observation seems to call into question whether, in this case, you are correct when you say &quot;but CSLA automatically makes sure only one call is actually honored.&quot; ?</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, May 09, 2006</h2><P>CSLA automatically makes sure one call through IEditableObject is honored. It honors <EM>all</EM> explicit calls to BeginEdit, etc. </P>
<P>But I think your issue comes from the same source. The current row in the grid has its edit level elevated. Then you open your modal dialog, and so that child object's edit level isn't where it should be. I think that <EM>before opening the dialog</EM> you need to do an EndEdit on the BindingSource for the grid, thus lowering the edit level of the child object to match that of its parent and siblings.</P>
<P>This way the modal dialog can do its own BeginEdit, and Cancel/ApplyEdit (or use the BindingSource to do it).</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>BARRY4679 replied on Tuesday, May 09, 2006</h2><p>Thanks, that works.<br /><br />I was getting confused thinking that the EndEdit would commit the change, but of course it won&#39;t because the row is a child.<br /><br />This is a tricky issue isn&#39;t it? We are having to explicitly back out the change to an invisible thing (editlevel) which was called by an implict call that we didn&#39;t make. This new .NET data binding support is helping productivity, but has it&#39;s traps for young players.</p></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>xal replied on Tuesday, May 09, 2006</h2>Just a question (I haven't tested this thoroughly yet):<br>Does this also happen if your collection has allowedit = false and your grid is read only?<br>I'm not sure the collection's allowedit has anything to do here, because it's the child raising it's edit level, but if you have the grid as read only it shouldn't be raising the edit level. Right?<br><br>Andrés<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Tuesday, May 09, 2006</h2>I haven't tested this with the grid and/or collection disallowing edit.</div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>albator replied on Tuesday, May 09, 2006</h2><P>Hi<o:p></o:p></P>
<P>I doesn't make the test with CSLA 2.0 but with the version 1.5 each time you move from one row to another in a readonly grid, BeginEdit is called causing serialization&nbsp;of the data bound business object.<o:p></o:p></P>
<P>The ApplyEdit /EndEdit/cancelEdit is never called because we don't make any modification operation on the row item.&nbsp; The edit level is incremented by one each time you select another row.<o:p></o:p></P>
<P>This has big&nbsp;resource and performance impact.<o:p></o:p></P>
<P>In CSLA 1.5,&nbsp;I made a patch for temporally disable beginedit(serialization) for business object bound to a readonly grid.<o:p></o:p></P>
<P>Do you think the problem still existing in version 2.0?<o:p></o:p></P>
<P>Is there another way to avoid BeginEdit execution on readonly grid?<o:p></o:p></P>

<P>John.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Wednesday, May 10, 2006</h2><P>1) There is no way I know of to prevent Windows Forms from calling BeginEdit. And if you defeat that call, then the user couldn't press ESC in a grid and have the cancel operation work. In other words, BeginEdit is actually required if you are doing in-place editing in a grid, or the user won't get the expected experience.</P>
<P>2) You <EM>do not</EM> have to manually call BeginEdit in .NET 2.0. I suggested doing that in the book, and it doesn't hurt anything - but in researching this issue it has become clear that the new BindingSource controls are very aggressive in calling BeginEdit (they do it immediately) and so there is no reason to call BeginEdit manually.</P>
<P>In .NET 1.x calling BeginEdit manually was wise because it avoided some edge case issues where edits could happen before BeginEdit was called automatically. But in .NET 2.0 this no longer appears to be the case and so I don't think calling it manually is important any more. Hopefully this addresses the UI developer confusion worry.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Norma_B replied on Thursday, June 29, 2006</h2><P>I'm hesitant to resurrect an older thread, but I'm having a problem with a situation almost like the one described here.</P>
<P>I have a Products object (type BusinessListBase) which contains Product objects (BusinessBase). The Products object is bound to a Binding Source, which is used by a grid. Users can select a Product from the grid to display information in databound controls on the same form. That part is &nbsp;working, as well as the code to save the Products back to the database.</P>
<P>Here's where it goes awry: The users can also select a Product and choose to edit it on another form. That form has a Binding Source, to which I pass the Product in question. They can use it to capture changes, and when closing the form have the choice to keep them (bsProduct.EndEdit) or discard them (bsProduct.CancelEdit). The first time the users open the form, capture changes, and save them, the changes are correctly saved. But second and subsequent times the form is used (and they are that indecisive, I've watched them do it), the changes do not make it, even though Product.IsDirty, IsValid (and therefore IsSavable, IIRC)&nbsp;are all True.</P>
<P>I've tried every fix proposed in this thread, to no avail. (but I've also put in almost 120 hours at work in the last 7 calendar days, so I'm not feeling very smart) Please tell me what I'm missing.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>RockfordLhotka replied on Thursday, June 29, 2006</h2>Do you call EndEdit on the first form's bindingsource, before passing the child object reference to the second form?

I call the first immediately after the object is populated by query or is new (which handles getting default values up on the form and all other fields cleared) and as the first action in my save button. After FillObjectFromForm has run, obj.IsDirty is true only if there were actually edits so puting the ApplyEdit and Save calls inside a test of obj.IsDirty avoids any unnecessary database calls.<br><br>It's simple, clean and trouble free AND it doesn't take 70 seconds to process the save like the bound version does, it only takes 500 miliseconds.<br><br>My conclusion: The CSLA Framework is great and MS data binding sucks. Any great thing can be dragged down by something really bad so I'm just going to side-step the bad and enjoy the framework.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Jimbo replied on Thursday, January 18, 2007</h2>Mr DanEssen sounds like the project manager who cant graduate from 1999
technology. yes, FillFormFromObject, and FillObjectFromForm methods
work fine in our vb6 apps, but that is just what we are attempting to
replace with business objects and binding sources. One of the aspects
that some poeple seem to misunderstand is that FillFormFromObject, and
FillObjectFromForm methods, while reliable, put a totally different
aspect on the overall application behaviour ( apart from OO) . The main
aspect being that the business object (class) is not in control.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>ajj3085 replied on Thursday, January 18, 2007</h2>Databinding is reliable as well, as long as you use it correctly.&nbsp; It sounds like the speed problems from DanEssen could easily be solved by turning of RaiseListChangedEvents to false while saving, then after the save turning it on again.<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Jimbo replied on Thursday, January 18, 2007</h2>Follow the master ajj<br></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Jimbo replied on Thursday, March 22, 2007</h2>This is an area that needs considerable help for most of my
co-developers. It is fine to say that it is covered in the book; but
this does not necessarily help in regard to concrete solutions. (
Project Tracker for example&nbsp; in v1.1.2 avoids the implementation
of undo) .<br>
Let me set out a typical rather basic scenario:<br>
<br>
We have a root collection business object.<br>
This is bound to a DataGridView via a BindingSource.<br>
In the UI (form) constructor, BeginEdit is set on the collection object. (standard stuff to initiate csla undo)<br>
An item in the grid is edited and you tab off the row.<br>
At this point the&nbsp; grid binding has (presumably)_ Applied the edit.<br>
You now click on Cancel (expecting to apply CancelEdit) but the edited row content remains undone.<br>
You may also have edited many rows.. again expecting that all edits
will be undone. As at no point did we manually or programatically call
Begin, Apply or CancelEdit. Meaning, to most peoples that the edit
level should still be at the point that we initiated in the constructor
and that all action since would be undone.<br>
But this is not the case ... Please explain how we deal with this and achieve the user experience that is expected.<br>

<div class=Section1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>I was at a conference last week, and am at a different one this
week (and unfortunately got the flu too &#8211; bad enough I spent half of
today in the hospital </span><span>L</span><span> )<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>While flying out to the conferences I did a little testing on
this, and my preliminary findings are that the DataGridView calls EndEdit &#8220;on
your behalf&#8221; when the grid loses focus. Of course it loses focus when you
click the Cancel button&#8230;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>If your cancel button is on a toolstrip though, then it doesn&#8217;t
get focus and the issue doesn&#8217;t appear to occur.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>I didn&#8217;t post this earlier, because I didn&#8217;t get a
lot of time to fully explore this effect, but given my past few days, it is
clear I won&#8217;t get to it until late next week at the earliest. Jimbo, you
may want to check on this focus/endedit issue and see if putting your cancel
button in a toolstrip solves your issue.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jimbo,<br>
<br>
You're right; there's no BeginEdit on the BS, but I think it will call that
automatically for you (there is an EndEdit).&nbsp; As far as going against the
book, if you search the forum you'll see that at the time of the writing, Rocky
wasn't aware of the problems of not keeping the BS 'in the loop.'&nbsp; He now
recommends you interact only with the binding source.<br>
<br>
Now, when you say its unreliable when applying changes programatically.. how
are you doing so?&nbsp; Are you calling EndEdit on the binding source?&nbsp; If
not, you'll run into similar problems.<br>
<br>
To successfully use the n-level undo, I think you'll have to keep a 'hands off'
approach until you actually want to cancel or accept all changes on the
collection... and then you should only do so through the binding source.&nbsp;
Data binding should be calling BeginEdit for you automatically.<br>

I'm asking if is this the expected behaviour. If not so, is it correct overriding the&nbsp; CopyStateComplete method on BusinessBase class end setting _bindingEdit to true, there?</P>
<P>I'm just a CLSA newcomer, so forgive me for the silly question, and for my english!</P>
<P>Thanks.</P><BR><BR><BR></BLOCKQUOTE></div></BLOCKQUOTE></div><p style='font-size:small'>Copyright (c) Marimer LLC</body></html>
