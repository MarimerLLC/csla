<P>Sure, you have an "Enter an Invoice" use case. But then you have a "Find an Invoice" use case where you need a list of invoice data, and a "Report Invoice Data" use case where you need something a bit different.</P>
<P>You are suffering from the single most common OO design anti-pattern: data-centric thinking.</P>
<P>Instead, you need to remember, as I discuss in Chapter 6, that every object has exactly one, simple, clear, responsibility. It is therefore impossible for Invoice to be responsible for "entering valid invoice data" and also for "displaying a subset of invoice data for selection" or for "displaying a subset of invoice data for reporting". All of these are different responsibilities and thus require different objects (classes).</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Luzius replied on Tuesday, July 11, 2006</h2><P>Hi,</P>

<P>1. make sure that this is what your users/BA are comfortable with (which is often true: normally people are confused if&nbsp;different views show different state of the same BO/entity); and generally, ogject sharing may not be an option with your requirements.</P>
<P>2. Take into account that if you go this way your objects would need to support greater sets of behaviours than they would otherwise; that would make the objects more data-centric.</P>

<P>I find a useful "litmus test" to be to think in the context of an object-oriented database.&nbsp; I've found this tends to be more useful in the particular discussion regarding whether a business object is just an abstraction of a database table such that there is basically a 1-to-1 relationship between business objects and tables.&nbsp; But in general when you consider that your business layer needs to work exactly the same if you replaced SQL with an OODB or even XML files it is sometimes very illuminating.</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>xal replied on Thursday, June 08, 2006</h2>The problem is that you're not diferentiating data from behaviour.<br>Yes, you have one invoice table, but it doesn't mean that you'll want just one object for that data.<br>So, what you should be asking yourself is:<br>What do I want to do with the data in the table?

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Part of this problem is the whole "objects are defined by their behavior, not their data" mantra.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I guess it is correct but there is a cognitive problem with it.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>With data it is easier for me, and I would assume most others as well, to conceptualize how one set of data subsumes another.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>Data by it's very nature is concrete and lends itself to this recognition.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Behavior by its very nature is amorphous.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>It is action.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>And how can one action subsume another (and I am NOT talking about inheritance).<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>Can it?<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>It hurts the brain to even think about it.</P>
<P><BR>This is phenomenon is well understood in OOP circles but not talked about enough in my opinion.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>Or rather it is talked about but not directly. I believe it is the main reason the whole agile/extreme programming methodologies arose because of this very thing.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>It is why you also have some still railing against OOP/OOD.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>Because it doesn't make sense to them.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>Truth be told it doesn't make sense to anybody if you want to sit down and actually define what you are doing.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>Kinda like trying to define what morals are or what pornography is.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>But back to your statement.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>Editable objects do, in many cases, satisfy a bunch of different use cases.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Xal Said: "Now that you know this, you realize that you want a list of Invoices (ReadOnlyCollection) that contains read only InvoiceInfo items (ReadOnlyChild). You also want an Invoice object (EditableRoot) that contains and editable list (EditableChildCollection) of LineItems (EditableChild)."</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>It could very well be that LineItem not only holds the same data as InvoiceInfo but also has the behavior needed to satisfy InvoiceInfo requirements.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>It becomes even more confusing when you start saying things like "performs fast" and "doesn't need to save, update."<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>Well LineItem may be able to save or update, but that doesn’t mean it has to.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Use cases are not really a lot of help in many cases.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>Even though a use case may say "Can Display needed information" it does not always say "cannot update or save information."<BR></P>
<P>And that is the question.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>If your use case can be satisfied by another object but that object provides more behavior than required do you use it?</P></div><div style='padding:0 15 3 15;background-color:powderblue'><h2>Michael Hildner replied on Friday, June 09, 2006</h2><P>Hello pelinville,</P>
<P>That was a great post. Gives me something to chew on. You summed it up nicely with "If your use case can be satisfied by another object but that object provides more behavior than required do you use it?".</P>
<P>That's exactly what I'm wondering, but couldn't say it succintly. Right now I've got read-only classes and editable classes and they both have fetch type methods. Since I'll have to maintain these when things change, I'm thinking it might be better to have the read-only class wrap the editable class and limit the funcationality. That way I don't have two methods in two classes that do the same thing.</P>
<P>But that also bugs me. One time I hired this guy who I guess knows more about OOP than me. I got&nbsp;a little flustered one&nbsp;time when he wrapped the System.IO.File class in his own class that only exposed the methods he needed. It satisfied his use case, but I thought it was stupid for a couple reasons. He had to write this limiting code, it increased the surface area of our app, and he'd have to modify two classes if he needed another method. Why not just use the class directly?</P>
<P>In a way it's nice to look at a class and know what it's supposed to do. I really have no idea of the best approach, and it smells like this will come with experience. I image this is one of those deals where there's no definitive answer, and you do what you think is best given your requirement.</P>

in FORTRAN). They called THEIR delete method rather than the one from the 
operating system. Talk about nice! It made the process of getting the code 
running on the VAX much simpler, because we rewrote this function library. All 
remaining issues (and there were plenty) were due to differences in the FORTRAN

<P>I understand your frustration.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Let me say first I am what Rocky would call a "mort".&nbsp; Secondly I must add that my formal training is in Cognitive Psychology so I could very well be reading way to much into the word "behavior". Combine those two statements and you could easily disregard anything I have to say.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>But...</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I have created classes that effectively limited another class.&nbsp;When I did this it was because I found the original class confusing and wanted to simplify. I didn't do it for any specific use case but, instead,&nbsp;because I am lazy and forgetful.&nbsp; Maybe that is what he was doing.&nbsp; (I think that is the idea behind the "My" namespace in VB.NET and it is absolutely wonderful.)</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If he did do it simply&nbsp;because of a use case I would say that&nbsp;is taking it to far.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I am going to post about what you are concerned about.&nbsp; There is a problem with&nbsp;having read only and editable and reporting and&nbsp;foo&nbsp;squared&nbsp;classes.&nbsp; I think that&nbsp;the&nbsp;problem is not only a maintenance one which is there even with code snippets and codegen. It is a problem with the statement "Objects are defined by behavior and not data" itself. Don't misunderstand, I think it is basically correct.&nbsp; However it does not capture the essence of class necessity as well a theorem could.</P>

characterize misuse of an object for a different responsibility as a form of 
"stress". It is like we all face in our day-to-day work. Most of us are software 
designers or programmers, yet from time to time we end up in staff meetings or 
dealing with personnel issues or stuff like that. It is crap, and we know it is 
crap and we dislike it and are stressed by it. If we get too much of it we 
eventually become discontent and our work starts to suffer. All because we are 
being diverted from our true responsibility.</FONT></SPAN></DIV>

<DIV align=left><SPAN class=034211503-10062006><FONT face=Arial size=2>The same is true with objects, but this "stress" shows up as conditional 
logic, extra branching, lazy loading and other things that complicate the code 
in a class. If you can't look at a class and almost instantly understand its 
responsibility then your class is too complex. If you look at a method and can't 
figure out how it fits into the context of the object's responsibility, then 
your object has become distorted. It is stressed.</FONT></SPAN></DIV>

<DIV align=left><SPAN class=034211503-10062006><FONT face=Arial size=2>Like with humans, when an object becomes stressed its work starts to

to go to the staff meeting, or do you need to finish that TPS report? Which do 
you do first? If you go to the meeting, are you thinking about the TPS report 
rather than focusing on the meeting? The same is true with objects. Is it a root 
or a child? Should it load that field or not? All questions that have NOTHING to 
do with its core responsibility, but which are artifacts of stress (complexity) 
the object has gained because it isn't being used for a single responsibility or

<P>"Objects are defined by behavior, not data"</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Now maybe I am just dense but&nbsp;this statement confuses&nbsp;me just as often as it helps me.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Rocky wrote "Sure, you have an "Enter an Invoice" use case. But then you have a "Find an Invoice" use case where you need a list of invoice data, and a "Report Invoice Data" use case where you need something a bit different."&nbsp; </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Now I am not trying to pick on anybody but this really throws me.&nbsp; I have seen this type of statement many times in this forum. On it's surface it appears rather elementary but when thinking about it is not so clear. Not only in the posts but also when I am designing my own cases. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Example:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I have a Object called Student and it has a set of responsibilities. But a Student has tons of data. It takes about 15 objects plus 15 fields.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>Of course as far as the object is concerned all this is just "stuff" and any of it can be added or removed without consequence to the class/object.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>There is another object, StudentCollection, that is responsible for controlling a list of students based on user needs.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>The user may want to act on students in a particular grade, or in a class or all students taught by a Teacher etc.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>(There are other objects such as ScoreCalculator that uses StudentCollection to do it's job).</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Another requirement of the application is to display the student data in a grid so that an administrator or secretary can see in a glance the relative information of the desired student.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Now Student has all the data needed but much of it, as mentioned, is contained in classes.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>Student has an Address object but that is really just data.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>It has an Enrollment collection but that is just data.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>That Enrollment collection has a behavior that knows what the last enrollment was.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>Every Enrollment object knows the Grade enrolled in and the Grade holds a collection of GradingScale (data).<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>But one of the Grades behavior is to know the default grading Scale. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>And on and on.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>So the student summary must, in part, show the Address fields, the enrollment fields and the grade fields plus the fields that the Student has.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The use case is something to the effect of "Display this data based on one or more of the following: grade enrolled, zip code living or date enrolled".</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>StudentCollection can already do all of what is asked and Student has all the data…. BUT!!!!</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Student cannot display it's information "easily".<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>Meaning you cannot bind the Collection to a grid and have all that information displayed to the user.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>At best the grid is smart enough to know that one of the data elements is another object so will allow drill down.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>It satisfies the use case but does not satisfy the user.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>At worse, and as is with most the grids I know, it simply shows the .ToString method of the object that contains the data field of the parent object.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>To overcome this I created a new class that exposes all the contained objects fields as properties. I did a supper fancy join to get all the fields and created one of those read only classes.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>And this bothers me to no end.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I am NOT doing this to satisfy a use case.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>I am doing it to satisfy some other "computer thing".<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>The control cannot be configured to display the fields of child objects.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>And please remember these sub objects are nothing but data as far as the Student object is concerned.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>With all this said the problem I run into is that Objects ARE, at least in part, defined by their data. It can not be denied and to do so is simple folly.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>My new class StudentSummary has no special responsibilities beyond Student. Both Student and StudentSummary has to expose it's data to a consumer. I will not change one character of Student.vb to satisfy StudentSummary.vb.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Well Maybe there is subtle behavior here? The user in this case is the particular windows component to be used. And it has a use case of "Display Student data like".</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>This causes the use cases to explode because how many components are available?<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>And if using anything like the MVC you can't even consider the components, can you?</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you do, then StudentSummary class would be a part of the Controller (or is it view?) and take a Student in the constructor and display the data in a certain format .<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>But that has huge performance and implementation implications.<SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp; </SPAN>Remember a Student has about 15 objects/classes (data).</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Which brings me to another point.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>Pure OOP/OOD is not concerned with performance or scalability. It expects the data to just be there. Now I don't think it should be concerned because OOP is not really a technology. It is a state of mind that technology tries to implement.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>But that also confuses the statement in question. Because while we shouldn't be concerned with the data when designing a class it cannot be ignored because said data could make the application unusable.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Ted Newards "Effective Enterprise Java" covers all these issues and I follow his advice.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>This advice often boils down to "whatever works the best".</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>So… </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>We don't really get paid enough, do we?<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>But I still think we need a sticky to justify and expand the statement "objects are defined by behavior, not data".</P>

<P>Those of us living in&nbsp;the Csla world have an added mental hurdle to jump over in the issue of behavior vs data and the related question of responsibility.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Every Csla object begins with data in instance variables, deals&nbsp;in and "mother hens" the data thru Property acessors, applies rules that are mostly data-centric, and fetches and saves the data.&nbsp; In other words, out of the box, 99% of a Csla object's functionality is like a intelligent suitcase full of data.&nbsp; And auto-generation methodologies neatly put a wrapper on this, since they all work with data tables. That is <STRONG><EM>not</EM></STRONG> a problem, of course - in fact Csla performs that indispensable function beautifully.&nbsp; It does, however, tend to make us see the world as being composed of nothing but Csla objects.</P>
<P>Three&nbsp;areas of responsibilty&nbsp;are always mentioned when talking about Csla objects. 1. Add new or update/delete existing data&nbsp; 2. Provide ReadOnly access to data, 3. Provide a list of "information items" in the data store.&nbsp; Of these, the second and third may or may not be limited to single tables, and it doesn't matter much&nbsp;because they are merely the front ends for a Sql query and&nbsp;I don't think that any of us have much problem grasping the use case or&nbsp;the behavior of these.</P>
<P>It is the first one, the Editable object, which causes the greatest difficulty in our understanding of behavior vs data, and unfortunately in these discussions&nbsp;is probably the hardest to dissect out in order to make the point. For one thing, the primary advertised responsibilty of an Editable Csla object pretty much has to do with DataTable(s), and by "definition" that reponsibilty is to fetch the data, guard it with&nbsp;its life, and&nbsp;when I&nbsp;modify it, save the changes back to the database.&nbsp; The trouble is that practically all of the custom code that gives an object its added "behavior"&nbsp;gets added to this type of object, hence the perennial question "why can't I reuse it" or "how can I reuse it" etc.&nbsp; Perhaps, it would help if there was a bit more discussion of OO kind of&nbsp;ways of how and why of this.&nbsp; </P>
<P>For example,&nbsp;talking about the Switchable object, it recently dawned on me that I can derive a switchable (Root) object by merely subclassing an existing child&nbsp;object and&nbsp;by removing the MarkAsChild call out of the child Constructor and making the child Constructor Protected and providing a Save method in the root.&nbsp; Similarly, I suppose what you are saying is that if there is functionality that we are stuffing into an Editable object, functionality&nbsp;that would be of use to other objects, it can be separated into a separate Class so it can be shared.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I say this mainly because one of my favorite books "Object Thinking" by David West says multiple times that responsibilities should be limited but at any rate kept to less than seven.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Maybe David West was refering&nbsp;to "Behavior" when he was speaking of responsibility?<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>I am not sure.</P>

<P>This the problem with current technology that frustrates me. Like I said the Student object has behavior and I think this behavior demands all the data needed.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>But it is some other part in the system which comes up short**.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>In an ideal world the idealistic and naïve could actually be such. And I think it will get there one day. Many things we take for granted today used to be "naïve thinking". Creating a basic Windows Form with a couple of lines of code for example. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>But even if I had the magic bullet (or the requirements of the application) allowed me to load all the Student data in one go I still would be stymied because of what I mentioned before.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>Data binding does not really handle arbitrary reference types all that well.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>(You can't define the display member to be "Address.Line1" for example.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>I find this kinda silly but that is the way it is.) </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>So this part of my frustration is rather juvenile and doesn't add to the discussion. But I hope that this negative, but hopeful, energy will be picked up, somehow, by the Einstein's of the world to be solved.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I do have many other questions but they are more specific than this thread allows.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>And it is quite possible that they would be out of place in this forum.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>(Which is why I have not asked them.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>Most of this place seems to be devoted to specific technical issues.) </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As Jav said, it would be very helpful if we could discuss how we can take the basics discussed in the books and expand it to real world issues.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>*And I often question whether this forum is the place to confess my confusion.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>But I figure since the first .NET BO book was the </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>**But this problem is caused by the current persisting mechanisms for applications built today. RDBMS's being a primary one. A thing that has, unfortunately, become used for all kinds of things that it isn't really designed for.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>For example OOP/OOD.</P>

<P>I think the discord for many developers comes from what Rocky referred to as a "naive and ideological" way of thinking.&nbsp; According to this mindset, object-oriented design and programming means that there should be a <EM>one-to-one</EM> correspondence between objects in your code and objects in the real world, and thus also between classes in your code and types of objects in the real world.&nbsp; According to this way of thinking, there should not be a Customer class <EM>and</EM> a CustomerInfo class, much less additional Customer classes for every other type of responsibility Customer entitiy might have.&nbsp; A customer is a customer, and should be represented by a single customer class.&nbsp; The real world, of course, dictates that if you're displaying a list of customers with 5 columns, you don't want to pull back all 80 columns for each one, any more than you want to bring back a million rows if the user only views 20 at a time.&nbsp; The idealist might say, "let me adapt the Customer class to only populate the columns that I need, and use lazy loading for the rest", while the behaviorist would say "I'll just implement a CustomerInfo class that does exactly what I need for this search results list, and when the user double-clicks one, then I'll instantiate a real Customer object for the user to view and edit."</P>
<P>Like many, I definitely come from this idealistic way of thinking.&nbsp; I think this was the appeal of object-oriented programming when I first started learning about it.&nbsp; However, like many others here, I've also come to see the advantage in a behavior-centric, such that you can ensure that only the behaviors that are appropriate in a given scenario are available.&nbsp; The difficulty in the change in thinking is that the concept of a "customer" is now more of an abstract concept that is not directly represented in your code.&nbsp; The business entity of "customer" is represented by the collection of classes the implement its responsibilities in various contexts, as well as the data in the database.</P>
<P>In my case, though I've bought into the idea of behavior-centric classes, I'm still stumbling a bit.&nbsp; In&nbsp;my application, I have the concept of a "request".&nbsp; A request is submitted by the client to the server to have some work done.&nbsp; The&nbsp;client submits requests and checks on their status until the requested work is complete.&nbsp; The server picks up requests from the queue, performs the work,&nbsp;updating the progress as it goes along, and finally marks the request complte.&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P>Following the idealistic approach, I would have a single Request object which implemented all of the functionality required by both client and server.&nbsp; This would obviously be bad, because even if you trust developers on both sides to use the object appropriately, it simply complicates things on both sides, because developers have to look at the full public interface of the class and determine which methods are appropriate for them.&nbsp; Therefore, it's definitely preferable to have separate ClientRequest and ServerRequest classes.</P>
<P>The stumbling block is this: both ClientRequest and ServerRequest require the exact same data.&nbsp; ClientRequest needs read-only properties to access the data, and ServerRequest needs read-write properties.&nbsp; To avoid duplicating the private data members in each class, you have to declare them as "protected" instead of "private", which is generally frowned upon.&nbsp; If understand Rocky's comments, the approach he generally takes is to just give in and duplicate the data members between the two classes.&nbsp; In principle, I am opposed to this sort of duplication&nbsp;- in my simple example, it's only the duplication of 10 private member declarations, but in more complex scenarios it would only get worse.</P>
<P>So, is it ok to violate encapsulation by making the private members protected?&nbsp; Or do we just give in and duplicate?&nbsp; Is there a better answer?</P>

<P>Thanks to both of you for your replies.&nbsp; I'll consider Andy's suggestions for class design.&nbsp; I'm not sure I agree that the client should have a Request and a RequestStatus class - I was planning on having a single ClientRequest class used for submission and status polling.&nbsp; I would argue that the the <EM>behaviors</EM> of submitting a request and polling the status fit within the <EM>responsibility</EM> of servicing the client, but I can see that I might be off base there (i.e. what I'm calling a <EM>behavior</EM> might actually be the <EM>responsibility</EM>, and the <EM>behaviors</EM> are actually more fine-grained).</P>

<P>Those of us living in&nbsp;the Csla world have an added mental hurdle to jump over in the issue of behavior vs data and the related question of responsibility.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Every Csla object begins with data in instance variables, deals&nbsp;in and "mother hens" the data thru Property acessors, applies rules that are mostly data-centric, and fetches and saves the data.&nbsp; In other words, out of the box, 99% of a Csla object's functionality is like a intelligent suitcase full of data.&nbsp; And auto-generation methodologies neatly put a wrapper on this, since they all work with data tables. That is <STRONG><EM>not</EM></STRONG> a problem, of course - in fact Csla performs that indispensable function beautifully.&nbsp; It does, however, tend to make us see the world as being composed of nothing but Csla objects.</P>
<P>Three&nbsp;areas of responsibilty&nbsp;are always mentioned when talking about Csla objects. 1. Add new or update/delete existing data&nbsp; 2. Provide ReadOnly access to data, 3. Provide a list of "information items" in the data store.&nbsp; Of these, the second and third may or may not be limited to single tables, and it doesn't matter much&nbsp;because they are merely the front ends for a Sql query and&nbsp;I don't think that any of us have much problem grasping the use case or&nbsp;the behavior of these.</P>
<P>It is the first one, the Editable object, which causes the greatest difficulty in our understanding of behavior vs data, and unfortunately in these discussions&nbsp;is probably the hardest to dissect out in order to make the point. For one thing, the primary advertised responsibilty of an Editable Csla object pretty much has to do with DataTable(s), and by "definition" that reponsibilty is to fetch the data, guard it with&nbsp;its life, and&nbsp;when I&nbsp;modify it, save the changes back to the database.&nbsp; The trouble is that practically all of the custom code that gives an object its added "behavior"&nbsp;gets added to this type of object, hence the perennial question "why can't I reuse it" or "how can I reuse it" etc.&nbsp; Perhaps, it would help if there was a bit more discussion of OO kind of&nbsp;ways of how and why of this.&nbsp; </P>
<P>For example,&nbsp;talking about the Switchable object, it recently dawned on me that I can derive a switchable (Root) object by merely subclassing an existing child&nbsp;object and&nbsp;by removing the MarkAsChild call out of the child Constructor and making the child Constructor Protected and providing a Save method in the root.&nbsp; Similarly, I suppose what you are saying is that if there is functionality that we are stuffing into an Editable object, functionality&nbsp;that would be of use to other objects, it can be separated into a separate Class so it can be shared.</P>
