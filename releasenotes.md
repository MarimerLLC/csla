I am pleased to announce the release of CSLA .NET version 4.7.200 with support for Blazor, and enhanced support for ASP.NET Core and Xamarin.

The packages are now in NuGet.

This is a pretty big release, focused on four key areas:

* Improved sample code
* Enhanced support for ASP.NET Core
  * The new `CslaModelBinderProvider` and `CslaModelBinder` types support data binding in Razor Pages scenarios
* Enhanced support for Xamarin
  * Updated for Xamarin Forms 3.0; Enhanced the `PropertyInfo` type, Fixed critical bug in `GraphMerger` on iOS
* Support for Blazor (and mono/wasm)
  * Add support for Blazor so it is possible to use CSLA objects in client-side mono/wasm code in a Blazor app, reference the `CSLA-Core-NS` package from your Blazor client app to use CSLA

## Important notes

There continue to be two "families" of CSLA .NET packages in NuGet. One that supports full .NET and one that supports all other runtimes. The following work item is tracking when this is resolved (after Microsoft fixes a bug in full .NET):

* [#822](https://github.com/marimerllc/csla/issues/822)OnDeserialized attribute from NS2 causes runtime error in full .NET

In the meantime, the full .NET family (based on the `CSLA-Core` package) must be used for the following types of app:
* Windows Forms
* WPF
* ASP.NET (other than Core)
* Console apps (other than Core)
* Azure Functions
* Any other runtime hosted by full .NET 4.6.1+

The netstandard family (based on the `CSLA-Core-NS` package) must be used for the following types of app:
* Xamrin
* UWP
* .NET Core
* ASP.NET Core
* Blazor
* Any other runtime _not_ hosted by full .NET 4.6.1+

What this means for you is that if your n-tier app is 100% full .NET or full netstandard then you can live within one of those families. BUT if your server is full .NET and your client is Xamarin (for example) then your _business library_ assemblies need to be compiled twice: once for full .NET and once for netstandard.

The `Samples\ProjectTracker` app shows how this is done by using a Shared Project to contain the code, and two concrete class library projects that compile the code for full .NET and netstandard respectively.
